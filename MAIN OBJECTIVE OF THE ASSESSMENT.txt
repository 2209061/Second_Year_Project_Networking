MAIN OBJECTIVE OF THE ASSESSMENT:

The main objectives of this assessment are to (a) demonstrate that you have learned the fundamental issues of 
networks and operating systems in the tutorials, (b) be able to set up and test a simple network in support of 
this, and (c) be able to troubleshoot problems with distributed systems. 


These objectives satisfy the following learning outcomes of the module as re-stated below: 
LO1: Demonstrate understanding of the fundamental networking and operating system 
technology issues
LO2: Set up and test a simple network.
LO3: Assess requirements and problems that arise when a distributed system is designed and 
implemented.


DESCRIPTION OF THE ASSESSMENT:


You are the IT manager at the local primary school and are in charge of the new virtual learning application deployment 
in your school. NOSSoft distributes the client-server applications calcClient and calcServer that allow users to 
perform the four basic maths operations. Your school has been using this for some time and is happy with its 
functionality. However, NOSSoft has released calcClientUpdate and calcServerUpdate and, after testing, you 
have discovered that it does not work properly. The problem is that NOSSoft does not believe you and has 
repeatedly said that there must be something wrong with your network setup.
You need to prove to them that their update and not your network is the problem!
